# One Dark for Sublime Babel [![VS Code marketplace button](http://vsmarketplacebadge.apphb.com/installs/joshpeng.theme-onedark-sublime.svg)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=joshpeng.theme-onedark-sublime)
Proper port of Atom's One Dark theme for Visual Studio Code. Optimized for use with [Sublime Babel](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=joshpeng.sublime-babel-vscode).

This extension not only brings the colors as envisioned by Atom, but also fixes many of their scoping inconsistencies and issues for the ultimate One Dark experience :]

## One Dark vs. One Dark+

One Dark+ deviates from Atom to provide more consistent coloring between programming languages while using JavaScript's colors as the base model. Currently One Dark+ only benefits Python and CSS files.

Notice the colorization of operators and function names that isn't available in Atom's One Dark.
