# Winter is Coming theme for VS Code

This extension for Visual Studio Code adds two themes titled "Winter is Coming". There are both dark and light themes.

I personally use the dark theme for most occasions, but find the light theme good on some dimmer projectors when I present.

See the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/johnpapa/vscode-winteriscoming/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for the latest changes.

Some styles in VS Code aren't controlled by the `settings.json`.

1. install [`Custom CSS and JS Loader` extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=be5invis.vscode-custom-css)
1. Create a file on your computer to hold your custom CSS named `~/.vscodestyles.css`

1. Point your `settings.json` to the file you just created
    ```json
      "vscode_custom_css.imports": [
        "/Volumes/Macintosh HD/Users/yourname/.vscodestyles.css"
      ]
    ```
1. Open your command palette
1. Select `enable custom CSS and JS`
1. Reload VS Code

## Fonts

I am using a paid font titled `Operator Mono`. If you do not have that font, the settings above will move along to Fira Code or Inconsolata, until it finds an installed font.
