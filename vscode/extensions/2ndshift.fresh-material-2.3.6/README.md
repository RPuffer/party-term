## Icons
To match the screenshot icons, install [Material Icon Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PKief.material-icon-theme)

## IMPORTANT UPDATE
Visual Studio Code 1.12.0 removed the experimental version of workbench theming. It allows for more customization but, unfortunately, is incompatible with VSCode version <1.12.0. I have updated my theme to work on the latest but, if for some reason, you don't want to upgrade VSCode, version [1.5.0](https://github.com/ambidexterich/vscode-fresh-material/tree/1.5.0) should still work.

## Issues
I created this theme through manual scope lookup. If you find any colors that I missed for the UI or a language syntax or you want a language added, open an [issue](https://github.com/ambidexterich/vscode-fresh-material/issues). Please include a code sample.

## Credits
UI Theme - Adapted from atom-material using the purple primary and accent color.
