Polymer syntax highlighting for VS Code!

# Polymer Syntax Theme

A syntax theme to be used with [language-polymer](https://github.com/jonathanwolfe/language-polymer) to give the best visual experience when working with [Polymer](https://polymer-project.org) or even [Web Components](https://www.webcomponents.org) in general.

## VS Code

https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jonwolfe.language-polymer

**To Enable**: You have to tell VS Code to associate the Polymer grammar with `.html` files either by the grammar selector in the bottom right corner of the editor or [via the settings](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/vMarch#_editor) (language name is `polymer`).

### History

Originally converted from the [Ember HTMLBars](https://atom.io/packages/language-ember-htmlbars) package. Then rewritten using the [Language-HTML](https://atom.io/packages/language-html) package.

This theme was based on the theme ["Made of Code" by Brian Yu](https://github.com/brian-yu/made-of-code-vscode). Almost everything is the same except for some additional selectors to correctly style the polymer binding related syntax.

### Contributing

Contributions are greatly appreciated. Please fork this repository and open a pull request make grammar tweaks, etc.
