# theme-bluloco-dark

## Description
A fancy but yet sophisticated dark designer color scheme for tmTheme based editors (sublime text, textmate, visual studio code, ...).

Originally forked from the beatiful One Dark Theme, enhanced with the meaningful intuitive bluloco color palette.

Give it a try :)

## Screenshots
Here are a bunch of screenshots.
I tested a long range of languages, these are just a few.
